# Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker
## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

Get an input from the user.

Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable a.

Use the modulo operator % to check if a % 2 == 0.

If true, print "EVEN".

Else, print "ODD".

End the program.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

``` python


a=int(input("Enter a number: :))
if a%2==0:
   print("Even")
else:
   print("Odd")

```

## Output

## Result

a Python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements is successful

#Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

##ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False.

##ðŸ§  Algorithm

Set variable a to the result of the expression 0 == True.

Set variable b to the result of the expression False == False.

Set variable c to the result of the expression True + True.

Set variable d to the result of the expression False + 9.

Print the value of a with the label "a is".

Print the value of b with the label "b is".

Print the value of c with the label "c:".

Print the value of d with the label "d:".

##ðŸ’» Program

''' python

a = (1 == True)

b = (1 == False)

c = True + 3

d = False + 7

print("a is True")
print("b is False")
print("c:",c)
print("d:",d)

'''


##Output

##Result

a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False is successful.

#Datatypes-Character Literal in Python

##ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters 'T' and 'a' using character literals.

##ðŸ§  Algorithm

Print the character 'T'.

Print the character 'a'.

##ðŸ§¾ Program

''' python

v = 'T'

w = "a"

print(v)

print(w)


##Output

![442064001-1c4acf7f-aeb1-4bbc-baec-d4ed7ec193b2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7dc5c21-f3d8-4533-a466-a661544dacf3)


##Result

a Python program that prints the characters 'T' and 'a' using character literals is successful

ðŸ§® Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

#ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

##ðŸ§  Algorithm

Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable a (real part).

Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable b (imaginary part).

Create a complex number x using the complex(a, b) function.

Print the complex number x.

Print the real part of x using x.real.

Print the imaginary part of x using x.imag.

##ðŸ’» Program

''' python


a=int(input())

b=int(input())

x=complex(a,b)

print(x)

print(x.real)

print(x.imag)


##Output
